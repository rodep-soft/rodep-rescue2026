[WARN] [1761651125.381225079] [rqt_gui_cpp_node_43333]: [image_transport] It looks like you are trying to subscribe directly to a transport-specific image topic '/image_raw/zstd', in which case you will likely get a connection error. Try subscribing to the base topic '/image_raw' instead with parameter ~image_transport set to 'zstd' (on the command line, _image_transport:=zstd). See http://ros.org/wiki/image_transport for details.
